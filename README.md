# WeatherAPP
In this project we used Open Weather API to make a simple application that can give you current and future forecast for and city you search. 
We took what we learned about AJAX and used it to call the api to get the data back from Open Weather.
I worked on this project locally and will practice pushing up as i go to show the piece by piece progress.
